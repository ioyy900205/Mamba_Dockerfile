# Mamba_Dockerfile
 
Mamba Docker Image Repository
Purpose
The main goal of this repository is to facilitate the construction of Docker images for Mamba. While working on a project, I encountered an issue for which a Dockerfile for Mamba was needed, however upon searching the web, I didn't find an available Dockerfile to assist with this task. Consequently, I found it necessary to provide a useful Dockerfile for the community, to make the use of Mamba in a Docker environment smooth and efficient.
